## YOLOv8 Based Lightweight American Sign Language and Gesture Recognition

📌 *Overview*

This project leverages YOLOv8, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect and classify individual American Sign Language (ASL) hand signs in real time using a webcam. It is designed as a lightweight solution for detecting alphabetic signs but does not yet include sentence construction or translation features.

🎯 *Features*

Real-time hand sign detection using YOLOv8

Lightweight and efficient for alphabet gesture classification

Easily extendable to more gestures or integration with translation systems

Uses trained custom dataset for ASL gestures

🛠️ *Technologies Used*

Python

YOLOv8 (via Ultralytics)

OpenCV

MediaPipe

🚀 *How to Run*

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the main detection script:

python main.py

Show ASL hand signs in front of the webcam to see the detected output in real time.
